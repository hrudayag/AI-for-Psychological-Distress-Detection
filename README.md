# AI-for-Psychological-Distress-Detection
This repository supports the research project "Multimodal Federated Learning for Mental Health Detection". The project aims to detect depression and PTSD using multimodal data — including text (BERT), speech (OpenSMILE), and facial expressions (OpenFace) — in a federated learning setup that protects user privacy. The model integrates LSTM, explainable AI tools like SHAP and LIME, and is implemented in PyTorch. The repository includes scripts for preprocessing, model training, fusion, and simulation of decentralized learning.
